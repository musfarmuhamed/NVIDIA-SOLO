I am traditionally coder by training. Hence I already had a view on how the code should look like. The AI had gave almost all the code as I thought, except for one (which use `class`, I thought `class` is not needed there). 

I had looked at each step, one by one and checked whether it makes sense. So steps where wrong, some steps where missing, and some like `four_qubit_rotation_block` where AI said gave first few and said so on. hahaha. 

Hence I believe I have corrected all the mistakes of Gemini.

I am still updating the code to be more efficient. I will write some `test` when I finish other things.
